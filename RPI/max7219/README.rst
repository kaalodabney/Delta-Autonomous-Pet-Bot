Interfacing LED matrix displays with the MAX7219 driver
`[PDF datasheet] <https://raw.github.com/rm-hull/max7219/master/docs/MAX7219-datasheet.pdf>`_
in Python (both 2.7 and 3.x are supported) using hardware SPI on the Raspberry Pi. A LED matrix can be acquired for a few pounds from outlets like 
`Banggood <http://www.banggood.com/MAX7219-Dot-Matrix-Module-DIY-Kit-SCM-Control-Module-For-Arduino-p-72178.html?currency=GBP>`_.
Likewise 7-segment displays are available from `Ali-Express <http://www.aliexpress.com/item/MAX7219-Red-Module-8-Digit-7-Segment-Digital-LED-Display-Tube-For-Arduino-MCU/1449630475.html>`_ or `Ebay <http://www.ebay.com/itm/-/172317726225>`_.

This library supports:

* multiple cascaded devices
* LED matrix and seven-segment variants

Python Usage
------------

For the matrix device, initialize the ``matrix`` class:

.. code:: python

  import max7219.led as led

  device = led.matrix()
  device.show_message("Hello world!")

For the 7-segment device, initialize the ``sevensegment`` class:

.. code:: python

  import max7219.led as led

  device = led.sevensegment()
  device.write_number(deviceId=0, value=3.14159)

The MAX7219 chipset supports a serial 16-bit register/data buffer which is
clocked in on pin DIN every time the clock edge falls, and clocked out on DOUT
16.5 clock cycles later. This allows multiple devices to be chained together.

When initializing cascaded devices, it is necessary to specify a ``cascaded=...``
parameter, and generally methods which target specific devices will expect a
``deviceId=...`` parameter, counting from zero.

Pre-requisites
--------------

By default, the SPI kernel driver is **NOT** enabled on the Raspberry Pi Raspian image.
You can confirm whether it is enabled using the shell commands below::

  $ lsmod | grep -i spi
  spi_bcm2835             7424  0 

Depending on the kernel version, this may report **spi_bcm2807** rather than **spi_bcm2835** - 
either should be adequate.

And that the devices are successfully installed in ``/dev``::

  $ ls -l /dev/spi*
  crw------- 1 root root 153, 0 Jan  1  1970 /dev/spidev0.0
  crw------- 1 root root 153, 1 Jan  1  1970 /dev/spidev0.1

If you have no ``/dev/spi`` files and nothing is showing using ``lsmod`` then this
implies the kernel SPI driver is not loaded. Enable the SPI as follows (steps
taken from https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/raspberry-pi-spi-and-i2c-tutorial#spi-on-pi):

#. Run ``sudo raspi-config``
#. Use the down arrow to select ``9 Advanced Options``
#. Arrow down to ``A6 SPI.``
#. Select **yes** when it asks you to enable SPI,
#. Also select **yes** when it asks about automatically loading the kernel module.
#. Use the right arrow to select the **<Finish>** button.
#. Select **yes** when it asks to reboot.

After rebooting re-check that the ``lsmod | grep -i spi`` command shows whether
SPI driver is loaded before proceeding. If you are stil experiencing problems, refer to the official 
Raspberry Pi `SPI troubleshooting guide <https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/spi/README.md#troubleshooting>`_ for further details, or ask a `new question <https://github.com/rm-hull/max7219/issues/new>`_ - but please remember to add as much detail as possible.

GPIO pin-outs
-------------

The breakout board has two headers to allow daisy-chaining:

============ ====== ============= ========= ====================
Board Pin    Name   Remarks       RPi Pin   RPi Function
------------ ------ ------------- --------- --------------------
1            VCC    +5V Power     2         5V0
2            GND    Ground        6         GND
3            DIN    Data In       19        GPIO 10 (MOSI)
4            CS     Chip Select   24        GPIO 8 (SPI CE0)
5            CLK    Clock         23        GPIO 11 (SPI CLK)
============ ====== ============= ========= ====================

**Note**: See below for cascading/daisy-chaining, power supply and level-shifting.

Installing the library
----------------------

**Note**: The library has been tested against Python 2.7 and 3.4. For **Python3** installation, substitute ``pip`` ⇒ ``pip3``, ``python`` ⇒ ``python3``, ``python-dev`` ⇒ ``python3-dev``, and ``python-pip`` ⇒ ``python3-pip`` in the instructions below.

Install the latest version of the library directly from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=display&name=max7219>`_::

  $ sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip
  $ sudo pip install max7219

Alternatively, clone the code from github::

  $ git clone https://github.com/rm-hull/max7219.git
  $ cd max7219
  $ sudo pip install -e .

Next, follow the specific steps below for your OS.

Raspbian
^^^^^^^^

.. code:: bash

  $ cd max7219
  $ sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip
  $ sudo pip install spidev
  $ sudo python setup.py install

Arch Linux
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: bash

  cd max7219
  pacman -Sy base-devel python2
  pip install spidev
  python2 setup.py install

Cascading, power supply & level shifting
----------------------------------------

The MAX7219 chip supports cascading devices by connecting the DIN of one chip to the DOUT
of another chip. For a long time I was puzzled as to why this didnt seem to work properly
for me, despite spending a lot of time investigating and always assuming it was a bug in
code.

- Because the Raspberry PI can only supply a limited amount of power from the 5V rail,
  it is recommended that any LED matrices are powered separately by a 5V supply, and grounded
  with the Raspberry PI. It is possible to power one or two LED matrices directly from a
  Raspberry PI, but any more is likely to cause intermittent faults & crashes.

- Also because the GPIO ports used for SPI are 3.3V, a simple level shifter (as per the diagram
  below) should be employed on the DIN, CS and CLK inputs to boost the levels to 5V. Again it
  is possible to drive them directly by the 3.3V GPIO pins, it is just outside tolerance, and
  will result in intermittent issues.

Despite the above two points, I still had no success getting cascaded matrices
to work properly.  Revisiting the wiring, I had connected the devices in serial
connecting the out pins of one device to the in pins of another. This just
produced garbled images.

Connecting the CLK lines on the input side all together worked first time. I
can only assume that there is some noise on the clock line, or a dry solder
joint somewhere.

   :alt: max7219 cascaded

If you have more than one device and they are daisy-chained together, you can initialize the
library with:

.. code:: python

  import max7219.led as led

  device = led.matrix(cascaded = 3)
  device.show_message("Hello world!")

To address a specific device, most other methods expect a ``deviceId=N`` parameter 
(where N=0..cascaded-1).

Examples
--------

Run the example code as follows::

  $ sudo python examples/matrix_test.py

or::

  $ sudo python examples/sevensegment_test.py

**Note**: By default, SPI is only accessible by root (hence using ``sudo`` above). Follow `these <http://quick2wire.com/non-root-access-to-spi-on-the-pi>`_ instructions to create an ``spi`` group, and adding your user to that group, so you don't have to run as root.
